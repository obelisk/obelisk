Rust developer 🦀 but lots of previous Go ([goquery](https://github.com/AbGuthrie/goquery)) and C++ ([osquery](https://github.com/osquery/osquery)) work.

Currently: 🛠️ing things that should exist under permissive licences for everyone to use.

## Useful Projects
### [Rustica](https://github.com/obelisk/rustica) 🦀 🔐
Scale hardware SSH keys for access and code signing across your infrastructure and developers. Cryptographically guarantee hardware backed and hypershort lived certificates that never need revocation.

### [Exhibit](https://github.com/obelisk/exhibit) ✨📱✨
Give interactive presentations without giving external services access to your slide data. Major updates coming soon.

## Useful Libraries
### [Endpoint Security Rust Bindings](https://github.com/obelisk/endpointsecurity) 🛡️
Build your own memory safe endpoint security product for macOS (and eventually maybe other *OS platforms 🤔). Helpful abstractions over many events ES provides with it being easy to add more.

### [sshcerts](https://github.com/obelisk/sshcerts) 🔐 🔑
Very functional SSH certificates and keys library built in Rust. Even handles generation and validation of SSH hardware key attestation data for FIDO devices.
